We’re looking for someone to help develop our visual communication — to help shape waye's design // storytelling.

### Ideal collaboration looks like:
- We discuss ideas, share copy, project descriptions, etc.  
- You define an explicit scope of work. Think quick turnaround and incremental deliverables.
- You bring the vision to life in a variety of mediums (website, email, presentations, etc.) 

### Ideal person:
- Efficient execution — gets to 80% value quickly.   
- Flexible: website work, practical email templates, and whatever else is up your sleeve  
- Creative ideas for making content digestible and engaging - we love when visuals reduce word counts. 
- Sense of humor & the ability to translate it to digital communication (hell yes to memes)  

### Details:
- You are well versed in Figma
- We start with scoped, contract-based projects  
- Ideal path = more involvement over time

We value **project ownership** and **creativity in communicating**.
