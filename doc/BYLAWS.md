ARTICLE 2
Board of Directors
```
**2.01. INITIAL MEETING OF THE BOARD.** The Board has conducted and completed the initial
meeting necessary to begin the business operations of the Corporation, including the adoption of these Bylaws. At the initial meeting of the Board, the initial directors were appointed to their respective staggered terms, and at least one director was appointed to an abbreviated term set to expire upon occurrence of the first annual meeting of the Board whereby that director can either be re-elected or replaced by the Board pursuant to these Bylaws.


**2.02. POWERS AND NUMBERS.** The management of all the Corporation’s affairs, property,
and interests shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. Directors need not be members of the Corporation or residents of the state of incorporation to qualify and serve the Corporation as a director. Until these Bylaws are amended, the Board consists of three (3) directors who are elected for the term of two (2) years, and will hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified at the following annual meeting of the Board. Successor directors will be elected each year to replace or re-elect the incumbent director.

**2.03. DIRECTOR LIABILITY.** Each director is required, individually and collectively, to act in good faith, with reasonable and prudent care, and in the best interest of the Corporation. If a director acts in good faith and in a manner that is reasonably in line with the best interests of the Corporation as determined by a reasonably prudent person situated in similar circumstances, then they shall be immune from liability arising from official acts on behalf of the Corporation. Directors who fail to comply with this section of these Bylaws shall be personally liable to the Corporation for any improper acts and as otherwise described in these Bylaws.

**2.04. CLASSES OF DIRECTORS.** Until such time as these Bylaws are accordingly amended,
the Corporation does not have classes of directors.

**2.05. CHANGE OF NUMBER.** The Board may increase or decrease the number of directors at
any time by amendment of these Bylaws, pursuant to the process outlined in Article 8 of these Bylaws. A decrease in number does not have the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. If the established number of directors is decreased, the directors shall hold their positions until the next meeting of the Board occurs and new directors are elected and qualified. The Corporation must have at least three (3) directors.

**2.06. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.** Directors are to be voted on and elected at each annual
meeting of the Board, unless a special meeting is expressly called to remove a director or fill a vacancy. If a director is elected, but is not yet qualified to hold office, then the previous director shall holdover until such time that the newly elected director is so qualified.

**2.07. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS.** At any meeting of the Board called expressly for that
purpose, any director, including the entire Board, may be removed by an affirmative majority vote by the current Board. If the Board votes to remove the entire Board, then the President, Treasurer, and Secretary will serve as the interim Board until directors are duly elected to the Board pursuant to these Bylaws. If the Corporation has members, then the members must promptly have a special meeting to elect directors to the Board. As soon as practical, the members or the interim Board must meet to elect directors via the process described in Section 2.02 of these Bylaws.

**2.08. VACANCIES.** All vacancies in the Board may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority  of the remaining directors, provided that any such director who fills a vacancy is qualified to be a director and shall only hold the office for the term specified in Section 2.02 of these Bylaws and until a new director is duly elected by the Board or members. Any vacancy to be filled due to an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the Board for a term lasting until the next annual election of directors by the Board at the annual meeting or a special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors. Any director elected to fill a vacancy which results from the
removal of a director shall serve the remainder of the term of the removed director and until a successor is elected by the Board and qualified. Any individual who fills a vacancy on the Board shall not be considered unqualified or disqualified solely by virtue of being an interim director.

**2.09. REGULAR MEETINGS.** The meetings of the Board or any committee may be held at the
Corporation’s principal office or at any other place designated by the Board or its committee, including by means of remote communication.

**2.10. SPECIAL MEETINGS.** Special meetings of the Board may be held at any place and at
any time and may be called by the President, Vice President, Secretary, or Treasurer, or any director. Any special meeting of the Board must be preceded by at least forty-eight (48) hours' notice of the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting, unless these Bylaws require otherwise.

**2.11. ACTION BY DIRECTORS WITHOUT A MEETING.** Any action which may be taken at a
meeting of the Board (or its committee) may be taken without a meeting, provided all directors (or committee members) unanimously agree, and such unanimous consent is included in the minutes of the proceeding, filed with the corporate books/records, and sets forth the action taken by the Board.

**2.12. NOTICE OF MEETINGS.** Regular meetings of the Board must be held with reasonable
notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of the meeting. Notice may be given personally, by email, by facsimile, by mail, or in any other lawful manner, so long as the method for notice comports with Article 6 of these Bylaws. Oral notification is sufficient only if accompanied by a written record of the notice in the corporate books/records. Notice is effective at the earliest of:

```
A. Receipt;
B. Delivery to the proper address or telephone number of the director(s) as shown in the
Corporation's records; or
C. Five (5) days after its deposit in the United States mail, as evidenced by the postmark, if correctly addressed and mailed with first-class postage prepaid.
```
**2.13. QUORUM.** A simple majority of the current directors present prior to the start of a meeting constitutes a quorum, and a quorum is necessary at all meetings creating an action to transact business on behalf of the Corporation.

**2.14. MANNER OF ACTING.** Subject to the laws of the state of incorporation, as may be
amended from time to time, the act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present when the vote is taken shall be the act of the Board unless the Articles of Incorporation require a greater percentage.


**2.15. WAIVER OF NOTICE.** A director waives the notice requirement if that director attends or participates in the meeting, unless a director attends the meeting for the express purpose of promptly objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened. A director may waive notice by a signed writing, delivered to the Corporation for inclusion in the minutes, before or after the meeting.

**2.16. REGISTERING DISSENT.** A director who is present at a meeting at which an action on a corporate matter is taken is presumed to have assented to such action, unless the director expressly dissents to the action. A valid dissent must be entered in the meeting’s minutes, filed with the meeting’s acting Secretary before its adjournment, or forwarded by registered mail to the Corporation’s Secretary within twenty-four (24) hours after the meeting’s adjournment. These options for dissent do not apply to a director who voted in favor of the action or failed to express such dissent at the meeting.

**2.17. EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMITTEES.** The Board may create committees to delegate
certain powers to act on behalf of the Board, provided the Board passes a resolution indicating such creation or delegation. The Board may delegate to a committee the power to appoint directors to fill vacancies on the Board. All committees must record regular minutes of their meetings and keep the minute book at the corporation’s office. The creation or appointment of a committee does not relieve the Board or individual directors from their standard of care described in Section 2.03 of these Bylaws.

**2.18. REMUNERATION.** The Board may adopt a resolution which results in directors being paid a reasonable compensation for their services rendered as directors of the Corporation, provided the compensation is less than the operating costs of the Corporation. Directors may also be paid a fixed sum and expenses, if any, for attendance at each regular or special meeting of such Board. Nothing contained in these Bylaws precludes a director from receiving compensation for serving the Corporation in any other capacity, including any services rendered as an officer, employee, or third party service provider. If the Board accordingly passes a resolution related to committees of the Board, then committee members may be allowed like compensation for
attending committee meetings. At any time, a resolution of the Board that grants compensation to a director may be challenged by another director, provided the challenging director requests a special Board meeting specifically addressing the resolution related to director compensation. Any director who votes for a resolution related to director compensation may be held liable under Section 2.03 of these Bylaws if the resolved director compensation is unreasonably excessive, violates any section of Article 2 of these Bylaws, or unreasonably jeopardizes the nonprofit or tax-exempt status of the Corporation.

**2.19. LOANS.** No loans may be made by the Corporation to any director.

**2.20. INDEMNIFICATION.** Provided the director complies with the standard of care described in Section 2.03 of these Bylaws, the Corporation shall indemnify any director made a party to a proceeding, brought or threatened, as a consequence of the director acting in their official capacity. In the event a director is entitled to indemnification by the Corporation, the director shall be indemnified or compensated for reasonable expenses incurred as a consequence of
being connected to the Corporation and serving in good faith on its behalf.

**2.21. ACTION OF DIRECTORS BY COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT.** Any action which may
be taken at a meeting of the Board, or a committee, may be taken by means of a telephone or video conference or similar communications equipment which allows all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other at the same time. A director participating in a meeting by remote means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

Conflict of Interest
```
**9.01. PURPOSE.** The purpose of this Conflict of Interest Policy is to protect the interests of the OS Waye Foundation, a tax-exempt organization, when considering entering into a transaction or arrangement that could result in private benefit to an officer, director, or committee member. This policy supplements, but does not replace, applicable federal and Delaware state laws governing conflicts of interest for nonprofit and charitable organizations.

**9.02. DEFINITIONS.**

```
A. Interested Person: Any director, officer, or member of a committee with board-delegated
powers who has a direct or indirect financial interest as defined below.
B. Financial Interest: An individual has a financial interest if they, directly or indirectly through business, family, or investment:
 a. Have an ownership or investment interest in an entity engaged in a transaction or
arrangement with the Foundation;
 b. Have a compensation arrangement with the Foundation or with any individual or entity
involved in such a transaction; or
 c. Have a potential ownership, investment, or compensation interest in an entity or
individual negotiating such a transaction with the Foundation.
```
Compensation includes both direct remuneration and substantial gifts or favors. A financial
interest is not automatically a conflict of interest; it becomes a conflict only if the board
determines one exists as per Section 3.

**9.03. PROCEDURES.**

```
A. Duty to Disclose: Any interested person must fully disclose their financial interest and all relevant facts to the board or committee.
B. Determining a Conflict of Interest: The board or committee shall determine if a conflict exists, excluding the interested person from discussion and voting.
C. Addressing the Conflict:
 a. The interested person may present their case but must leave the meeting during discussion and voting.
 b. Disinterested board members may evaluate alternatives to the proposed arrangement.
 c. If no better alternative exists, the board may approve the transaction by majority vote, provided it is fair, reasonable, and in the Foundation’s best interest.
D. Violations: If a member fails to disclose a conflict, the board will investigate and take corrective actions, which may include removal.
```
**9.04. RECORDINGS OF PROCEEDINGS.** Meeting minutes shall document:

```
A. Names of interested persons, the nature of their financial interest, and the board’s
decision; and
B. Discussions, votes, and any alternatives considered during deliberations.
```
This policy underscores the OS Waye Foundation's dedication to transparency and ethical
governance, ensuring decisions are made in the best interest of the organization and its
mission.
