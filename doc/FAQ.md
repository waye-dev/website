## How we work:
**Do you care about privacy?**

We take privacy seriously. What you share stays with us.

**What does it mean to support a decentralized, open-source ecosystem?**

Open source & decentralization are two techniques to ensure resilience, which is essential for freedom technology. We understand it goes beyond code-it's about access, transparency, and collaboration. Here are some of our organizational values:
- We open-source everything – Our research, frameworks, and methodologies will be shared for anyone to use, adapt, and improve. 
- We encourage competition, not control – The best solutions emerge when multiple voices, perspectives, and contributors shape them.
- Bottom up, not top down – Waye is here to listen and share, not preach. We believe the best solutions come from your creativity, but we are here to elevate and support. We don’t dictate how tools should be used. You decide what works best for you.
- We strengthen human infrastructure – Decentralization is meaningless if the people building it burn out. Waye exists to support the developers behind the code, ensuring sustainability in open-source work.

Freedom goes beyond code. 

**Who can participate in the programs?**

We are grateful to be able to offer our programs on a proof of work model due to the financial support of HRF & OpenSats. This means if you are a dev who is making contributions to FOSS code, you are automatically eligible for our programs. 

## Need help?

Yes we do!! If you're excited to get involved, send us an [email](hello@waye.dev) & share your ideas and skillsets. 

Here are some areas that we are actively looking for support: 
- Designer – We have plenty of words. Too many, really. Help us communicate visually.
- Social Media Manager – Open-source developers need to know we exist. If you’re tapped in (or know how to be), we need you.
- Time Management Expert (or recommendation) – How do we do it all? Looking for a guest facilitator who can run a session to help OS developers manage time better.
