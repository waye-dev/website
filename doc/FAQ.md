## Verbiage:
**What does it mean to be decentralized?**

Decentralization isn’t just a technical structure—it’s a way of working, thinking, and supporting the people behind open-source innovation.
We open-source everything – Knowledge, frameworks, and research should be accessible to all, not locked behind paywalls or institutions.
We encourage competition, not control – The best solutions emerge when multiple voices, perspectives, and contributors shape them.
We elevate, not prescribe – Waye provides tools and resources, but we don’t dictate how they should be used. Developers, contributors, and communities decide what works best for them.
We strengthen human infrastructure – Decentralization is meaningless if the people building it burn out. Waye exists to support the developers behind the code, ensuring sustainability in open-source work.
Decentralization at Waye means freedom, resilience, and shared progress—for both technology and the people creating it.

**What is Proof of Work?**

Eligibility for programs is based on real contributions to open-source—not financial backing or paid models like traditional apps and coaching programs.

**What is open source?**

Open source isn’t just about code—it’s about access, transparency, and sustainability. We believe open-source development should be viable, supported, and free from burnout, so we take a broader approach:
- We open-source everything – Our research, productivity frameworks, and methodologies are available for anyone to use, adapt, and improve.
- We don’t gatekeep knowledge – Instead of prescribing solutions, we elevate ideas and give developers the tools to build their own.
- We focus on people, not just projects – Open source only thrives when the developers behind it are supported, which is why our work centers on reducing burnout, improving sustainability, and making contributions long-term viable.
- We work for the ecosystem – Our programs, research, and resources help ensure that open-source developers can keep building without being left behind.

For Waye, open source isn’t just software—it’s a way of thinking, working, and sustaining the people who make it all possible.

## Want to join us?

- Designer – We have plenty of words. Too many, really. Help us communicate visually.
- Social Media Manager – Open-source developers need to know we exist. If you’re tapped in (or know how to be), we need you.
- Time Management Expert (or recommendation) – How do we do it all? We need someone who can help OS developers manage time better so they can stay productive with the time we have.
