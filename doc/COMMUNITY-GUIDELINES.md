## 🛠️ Waye Community Guidelines

We’re here to support open-source contributors. To keep this space safe, kind, and useful, we ask everyone to follow a few simple rules:

### Respect each other.  
No harassment, hate, or discrimination—ever.

### Keep it inclusive.  
All backgrounds, identities, and experiences are welcome here. Diversity makes us stronger.

### Keep it private.  
Chatham House Rule applies: share ideas, not identities. What’s said in closed spaces stays there unless everyone agrees.

### Listen before you speak.  
Make space for others. Be curious, not combative.

### No spam or self-promo.  
We're here to support each other, not sell to each other.

### Assume good intent.  
We're all figuring this out—be generous and patient.

**That’s it. Be cool, be kind, sustain better.**
