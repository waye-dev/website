          Across levels of experience, contributors expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability, even as they acknowledged that their
          own positions may be temporary — a sentiment voiced most often by newer and mid-career developers. Many in this group view grant-funded
          development as a strategic career phase rather than a permanent destination. As noted earlier, 69% of participants had held their
          grant-funded roles for two years or less. This could reflect the ecosystem’s recent growth, normal career progression, or a deeper
          sustainability challenge:{" "}

          The ecosystem's health depends on retaining enough developers long enough to build deep protocol knowledge — but the current model is
          designed to encourage short-term contributions over long-term commitments. When developers leave, they take with them context and expertise
          that no amount of logging can fully preserve.

          However, contributors aren’t alarmed: they see Bitcoin work as a launchpad to other career opportunities in an expanding ecosystem. As one
          contributor (who had already left his grant-funded role) observed: “it doesn’t close any doors, it just opens them.” Many accept this
          replaceability as natural: "everybody's dispensable... it's the ecosystem that's important." But this normalization of transience means that
          critical knowledge quietly disappears every few years, with no pathways for contributors to remain engaged.

          Contributors recognize that sustainability requirements differ between core protocol and application. For those working on the protocol and
          its core infrastructure, grants are essential due to the lack of viable business model for their work. Those working on user-facing

          When application developers propose hybrid models for their projects — combining grants with revenue — they face skepticism from funders,
          which prevents the very sustainability it aims to encourage. For core infrastructure contributors, the limitation plays out differently:
          yearly grant renewals incentivize short term deliverables rather than long-term investments.

They don't want to, they prefer not to give a grant out to a project. And then also, they would prefer to only give grants out to completely free and open source projects. And then some of the projects I know, they have good ideas for creating for profit revenue streams which could help sustain their projects, but they're scared to do that because they don't want to lose the grants.

          Contributors adapt through taking breaks ("giving myself permission to not do stuff … and have faith that you will want to come back to it

          their absence could directly impact users relying on these tools. For many at this level, adapting to burnout becomes part of the job —
