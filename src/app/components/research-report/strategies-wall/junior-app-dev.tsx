              <p>
                Similarly to junior core developers, contributors working on user-facing applications are attracted by the opportunities to work in
                an expanding value-aligned ecosystem, but also struggle with autonomous decision making and self-management, as well as the added
                tasks of working on a product (communication, recruiting and retaining volunteer contributors, scaling the project). The ideological
                commitment and community focus drives daily motivation, while adding pressure to deliver.
