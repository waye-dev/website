            Bitcoin introduced a new possibility for open source: by creating a new form of digital money, it also created new capacity to fund
            its development.

          <p>
            The <strong>Bitcoin</strong> ecosystem, including <strong>Nostr</strong> as its primary decentralized communication layer, now
            supports hundreds of developers through an expanding grant landscape, enabling them to work full-time on OSS projects without
            institutional affiliation.

          <p>For the first time, the original OSS vision — sustainable, independent development — seems within reach</p>

          Yet this arrangement is still treated as a rarity, rather than the radical reimagining of work that it could be. Without institutional
          support, grant-funded OSS developers are expected to navigate engineering issues, project management, and community building on their
          own. We know little about how these developers work, nor how to support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If OSS is to deliver on its promise to decentralize the workforce, then we need to treat these developers' experiences as a primary way
          of working, rather than as the exception.
