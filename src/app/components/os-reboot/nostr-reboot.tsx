            In OS Reboot, we’re confronting the unspoken psychological challenges of open-source development head-on. Here’s just a taste of what
            we’ll tackle:

            And that’s just scratching the surface. We’ll go much deeper, with you driving the topics of conversation through our onboarding form. Our
            goal? To equip you with the psychological and social tools you need to not just survive, but thrive in the open-source world.

          <p className='text-lg leading-[160%]'>
            Meet Noemi Boyer - democracy's biggest fan and DemoLab's fearless leader. She's on a mission to shake up how Costa Rica and Latin America
            do democracy, one fired-up citizen at a time. Less dusty frameworks, more "let's get sh*t done."
            <br />
            <br />
            Now she's bringing her magic to OS Reboot as our facilitator extraordinaire. After years of coaching entrepreneurs and navigating startup
            culture, she knows a thing or two about getting brilliant minds to play nice together.
            <br />
            <br />
            In Noemi's sessions, expect zero snooze-worthy PowerPoints and all action. She'll help you turn those "wouldn't it be cool if..." moments
            into "holy cow, we actually did it!" victories. Because if there's one thing Noemi loves more than democracy, it's watching good ideas
            become great solutions.

            Amiti Uttarwar has been a bitcoin P2P protocol engineer since 2019. She's a mountaineer, meditator, and armchair philosopher. She’s
            coached and mentored over 20 full-time open-source devs, and is not slowing down anytime soon.
            <br />
            <br />
            Amiti is on a mission to spark critical engagement around questions like how we work. Now, she’s bringing her passion, creativity, and
            sometimes-kinda-aggro truth seeking energy to OS Reboot, building a program that helps devs dev longer.
