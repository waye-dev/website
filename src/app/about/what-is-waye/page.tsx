                    Our latest research study uncovered a sustainability paradox in open-source development: the more the experience, the more
                    unsustainable one‚Äôs work process becomes. This is particularly acute for contributors working on self-directed projects.

                    Contributors face both freedom and chaos. One of the things Waye does is to help approach these questions methodically so the
                    community is better informed to build more sustainable structures.

                    In the world of sports, everyone understands the value of a coach. Elite athletes don‚Äôt train alone- with the strategic support of
                    a coach, they focus on optimizing performance. Open-source coaching brings this principle to the realm of decentralized
                    development. We help knowledge workers build technology that matters.

                  The idea comes from 10x Is Easier Than 2x by Benjamin Hardy and Dan Sullivan. We adapted it for open source and introduced it in our
                  OS Reboot [Nostr] program. One participant, Pablo, used it to completely reframe his work. As an experienced open-source dev, he was
                  used to pushing nonstop, often sleeping only four hours a night. Open-source coaching encouraged him to step back and evaluate the
                  bigger picture, a process which he describes as ‚Äúextremely uncomfortable‚Äù. His 10x goal is to achieve greater productivity while
                  working at a computer just four hours a day, which led to developing AI tooling to support his projects. That‚Äôs a rocketship.

                    Understanding how the brain works helps us design structures that keep people focused, motivated, and resilient. Here‚Äôs an
                    example: the brain has two primary modes: the task-positive network (TPN) and the default mode network (DMN). The TPN activates
                    when you‚Äôre focused- whether solving problems or writing code. The DMN takes over when your mind wanders- it connects ideas and
                    makes sense of the bigger picture. Real transformation happens by harnessing their strengths and moving fluidly between the two ‚Äî
                    intense focus and reflective integration.
                  </p>
                  <p>At Waye, we build practices that help developers harness this rhythm. Work with your brain, not against it.</p>

                    A gardener doesn‚Äôt tell a seed how to grow. They don‚Äôt demand, ‚Äúbecome a flower, now.‚Äù Instead, they create the right conditions
                    of sunlight, water and healthy soil. Growth happens when the environment allows it.

                  <p>
                    This is the mindset we bring to coaching: to guide, not to control. Developers already have the potential. Our role is to help
                    them unlock it ‚Äî by removing obstacles, providing resources, and creating structures for sustainable growth to thrive.
