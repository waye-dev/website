                  Open-source development is often seen as the future of work—independent, decentralized, driven by purpose. But let’s be real:
                  <span className='font-semibold'> it’s the Wild West.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You’re not just writing code. You’re managing your own time, budget, and long-term sustainability. You’re chasing grants, navigating
                  community politics, and staying on top of ever-changing projects—all while trying to maintain deep focus and produce meaningful work.
                  There’s no roadmap, no structure, no safety net.
                  <span className='font-semibold'> It’s liberating, but it’s also exhausting.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burnout, isolation, and the challenges of independent open-source work are real and growing problems— widely felt but rarely discussed
                  in a structured, actionable way. There’s no shared language, no clear solutions, and no roadmap for improvement. Everyone feels the
                  weight, yet it remains nebulous—an open secret with no clear way forward.
